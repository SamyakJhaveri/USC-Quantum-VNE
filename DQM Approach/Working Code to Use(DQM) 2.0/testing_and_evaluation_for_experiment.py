"""
DQM Approach
Final Working Script to be used for Experiments. 

Script that prints (does not return) the infromation about the Solver in use and the meta information about the 
resultant sampleset from the DWave annealing of the problem.

(Optionally, we can set the time limit of running a job on the Solver/Sampler manually depending on our requirement. 
Will not do that actually test the timings but in a later stage could put that in just to play with the code)
Timings to account for 
(Based onthe Paper that compares the performance between 2000q and 5000 qubit Advantge System):
- `run time` is the total elapsed time including system overhead; 
- `charge time` is a subset of run time (omitting overhead) that is charged to the user‚Äôs account; and 
- `qpu access time` is the time spent accessing QPU. 

Note that the classical and quantum solver components operate asynchronously in parallel, so the total elapsed 
time does not necessarily equal the sum of component times.
